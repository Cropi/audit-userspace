Future roadmap (subject to change):
===================================
4.0.x
* Multi-thread audisp-remote
* Look into lazy parsing of audit records in auparse
* Change ausearch to output name="" unless its a real null. (mount) ausearch-report.c, 523. FIXME

4.1
* Basic HIDS based on reactive audit component
* Support multiple time streams when searching
* If searching user/group doesn't map to uid/gid, do translated string search

4.2
* Support TLS PSK as remote logging transport
* audisp-remote, add config to say what home network is so laptops don't try if their not on a network that can reach the server.

Someday...
* Container support
* Rewrite swig based python
