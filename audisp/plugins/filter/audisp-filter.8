.SH NAME
audisp-filter \- plugin to filter audit events and forward them to other plugins
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B audisp-filter
\fIMODE CONFIG_FILE BINARY\fP [ \fIBINARY_ARGS\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaudisp-filter\fP is an audit event dispatcher plugin designed to filter out specific events based on its provided configuration. Moreover, it possesses the capability to forward the remaining logs to other plugins. The plugin is universally compatible, allowing seamless integration with any existing audit plugin that expects audit messages on its standard input. Currently it supports the following arguments:
.RS
.TP
.B MODE
The operational mode can be either allowlist or blocklist. In allowlist mode, the plugin forwards everything except for events that match the specified ausearch expressions in the configuration. Conversely, in blocklist mode, it refrains from forwarding anything except for events listed in the configuration.
.TP
.B CONFIG_FILE
Path to the main configuration file containing ausearch expressions.
.TP
.B BINARY
Path to an external program that will consistently receive filtered audit events through its standard input.
.TP
.B BINARY_ARGS
Optionally, you can pass additional arguments to the external program.
.RE

.SH CONFIGURATION AND RULES EVALUATION
Every single plugin that wants to benefit from the event filtering capability, needs to create its own configuration file. It's a good practice to place it inside the audit config file directory as audisp-filter-pluginname, e.g.
.B audisp-filter-syslog.
Each line within a configuration represents an ausearch expression. Internally, lines are joined together using the OR operator.
Lines starting with a
.B '#'
character are treated as comments and do not influence the final rule set.
